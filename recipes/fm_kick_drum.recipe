name : FM Kick Drum
description : Simple Kick sound from FM synthesis.

[recipe]
osc_a : This osc is the fundamental tone of the kick. Consider setting the coarse to 0.5 for a deeper sound. Use a simple sine wave to start. If pitch is not fixed, follow the track's root or bassline. 
osc_b : Fast attack and decay to simulate the sound of a beater striking a drum head 
osc_c : White noise waveform with a little attack to simulate the noise of the drum head. The top end content will also help the kick cut through the mix.
osc_d : Off
lfo : Off
filter : Experiment with the position of the filter along with it's shaper and applied drive to give character to the kick. 
main :  Voices set to 1. Algorithm 1 works well, but others can produce unique kick sounds with the same fundamental approach.  
pitch : Turn the Pitch Env up with the envelope set to a high peak with a fast decay. This pitch envelope simulates the warping of a drum head when it is struck by a beater.
