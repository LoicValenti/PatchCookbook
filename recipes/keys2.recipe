name : FM Pad - Basic
description : FM Pad with long attack and decay

[recipe]
osc_a : Sine wave with very long attack (>500ms), long decay time (>500ms) and slight duck in sustain to create a long soft drone
osc_b : Copy waveform settings from Osc A and tweak. Slight variations in multiple waveforms over time creates a complex, evolving sound to the patch. Experiment with using different waveform.
osc_c : Copy waveform settings from Osc A and B and tweak. Slight variations in multiple waveforms over time creates a complex, evolving sound to the patch. Experiment with using different waveform.
osc_d : Off
lfo : Give the envelope a long attack and send the LFO to specifc oscillators to give the tone a pitch-shifting 'singing' quality. Experiment!
filter: User choice - can define any filter and shaper with drive to further define character and quality of the tone.
main :  Algo 1. Experiment with  aftertouch and velocity to give the keys a unique character of their own.
pitch : The pitch envelope can be used as a secondary LFO by pointing it's Dest. B at a desired parameter, adding more movement to the sound.
