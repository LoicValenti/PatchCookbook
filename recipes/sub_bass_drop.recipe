description : Bass Drop Effect Sound for transitions

[recipe]
osc_a :  Sine wave with fast attack and high sustain so the note can be held. Add complexity with more harmonics in the user waveform. 
osc_b : Long attack which will add character to the 'landing' of the bass drop. Experiment with your waveform choice too
osc_c : As with Osc B, adding more Oscs will add to the complexity and 'dirtiness' of the ending of the bass drop sound. 
osc_d : Off/Experiment
lfo : Experiment here to add interest, movement and complextity. Endless possibilities based on the specifics of your sound. 
filter : Experiment with the position of the filter along with it's shaper and applied drive to give character to the overall tone. 
main :  The time setting changes the global rate of all envelopes, this can help define the length of the effect. Experiment with algorithms
pitch : Turn the Pitch Env up (experiment) with the envelope set to a high peak with a long decay. Make sure sustain is 0 so you land on the correct note.
