[recipe]
osc_a : Sine wave with short attack and decay. Sustain should be very low to -inf. Release can be 0, but also produces an interesting effect when high.
osc_b : Sine wave with some attack. Find the sweet spot as you go.
osc_c : White Noise with some attack. 
osc_d : Off
lfo : Give the envelope a long attack and send the LFO to specifc oscillators to give the tone a pitch-shifting 'singing' quality
filter: Pull back on the filter frequency to mellow the white noise
main :  Set voices to 1. Algorithm 8. 
pitch : Activate Glide, set time to ~50ms. Tweak to  your liking
