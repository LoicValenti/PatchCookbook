[recipe]
osc_a : Sine wave with some attack, ~5ms. Find the sweet spot as you go.
osc_b : Optional, Define B as part of your patch's core tone as you go.
osc_c : Optional, Define C as part of your patch's core tone as you go.
osc_d : Optional, Define D as part of your patch's core tone as you go.
lfo : Give the envelope a long attack and send the LFO to specifc oscillators to give the tone a pitch-shifting 'singing' quality
filter: 
main :  Set voices to 1. Algorithm is user choice, but monosynths should have one carrier. 
pitch : Activate Glide, set time to ~50ms. Tweak to  your liking
