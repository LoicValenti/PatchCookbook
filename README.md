# OperatorCookbook


M4L Device for displaying device patch notes and instructions

## Overview

Ever been sitting in Ableton Live trying figure out how to make a simple Reese
Bass ? Tired of switch between windows (and may headsets) as you try to watch a
YouTube video and teak an operator device at the same time ?

OperatorCookbook is a Max4Live (c) device that you put in the same track as the
operator and gives you guidance on how to create all sorts of sounds using
operator.

section of the operator device.
